//given any integer array- nums. 
//returns TRUE if any value appears at least twice and FALSE if every statement is distinct
//MY IDEA: can use linear search. make int count=0 and in case of duplicate- count++. if count>0 return true; else return false;
// time: O(n^2) memory: O(1)
//SORTING: all the duplicates will come adjacent to each other. so we will have to move through the array once.
//time: O(nlong) memory: O(1)
// USE HASHSET
